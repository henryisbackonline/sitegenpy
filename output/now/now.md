# What am I doing now?

I started the third year of my land surveying degree with a subject on coding, which is interesting so far. I have a lot to write about, especially regarding my trip to Nepal that I went on. I’ll get to that at some soon.

I got a new full-time job in surveying, which is going to help my study so much. I’ll be able to apply what I’m learning to the field work, and use my field experience to help build my understanding of the theory.

Overall, going well.

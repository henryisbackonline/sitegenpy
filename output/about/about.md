# About me

👋 Hi, I’m Henry.

I study land surveying in Australia. I love technology, birds, renewable energy, woodworking, and transport infrastructure.

I have a goal for this blog.  I want to develop a healthier relationship with the internet. I enjoy making stuff and writing, and I need somewhere to put those things that isn’t a microblogging platform run by a big tech company. I’m hoping that a blog might just be that thing.

I’ll update this site regularly with whatever I feel is interesting at the time. I plan to write both long and short posts, and I’ll try not to talk about consumer technology too much.

You look great today.
